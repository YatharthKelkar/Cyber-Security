<h2>Phishing Attacks</h2>
<p><b>Phishing is one of the most common methods used in cybercrime.</b> The attacker typically impersonates a legitimate entity (such as a bank, tech company, or social media platform) in an attempt to trick the victim into revealing sensitive information like login credentials, financial details, or personal identification information.</p>

<p>How it happens:<br>

The attacker sends a fraudulent email, message, or website link that appears to come from a legitimate source.
The victim clicks on the link or attachment, which often leads to a fake website designed to look like the real one.
Once on the fake site, the victim enters their personal information, which is then captured by the attacker.</p>

<p>Common Tools:<br>
Fake websites, email spoofing, social engineering tactics.</p>

<h2>Malware (Malicious Software)</h2>
<p><b>Malware is a broad category of software designed to harm or exploit any device, service, or network.</b> It includes viruses, worms, ransomware, spyware, and more.</p>

<p>How it happens:<br>
The attacker infects a system by tricking the user into downloading or executing a malicious file (often disguised as something harmless, like a legitimate software update or document).
Once installed, the malware can do various harmful actions, including stealing data, damaging files, or locking the victim’s computer.
Ransomware is a particularly common type of malware that encrypts the victim’s files and demands a ransom payment for decryption.</p>
<p>Common Tools:<br>
Malicious attachments, drive-by downloads (websites that automatically install malware), and infected software or updates.</p>

<h2>Hacking and Unauthorized Access</h2>
<p><b>Hackers exploit weaknesses in computer systems or networks to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or resources.</b> These attacks can target individuals, organizations, or government agencies.</p>

<p>How it happens:<br>
Hackers scan for vulnerabilities in systems, such as weak passwords, outdated software, or poor security practices.
They may use techniques like brute-force attacks (where they try many password combinations), exploiting unpatched software vulnerabilities, or social engineering to bypass security protocols.
Once inside the system, attackers can steal, modify, or delete sensitive data, or even install backdoors for future access.</p>

<p>Common Tools:<br>
Exploit kits, brute-force attack tools, zero-day vulnerabilities.</p>

<h2>Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks</h2>
<p><b>These attacks aim to make a network service unavailable to its intended users by overwhelming it with massive amounts of traffic.</b></p>

<p>How it happens:<br>
In a DoS attack, a single machine floods a target system with traffic, often by sending malformed requests to exhaust system resources.
In a DDoS attack, the attack is distributed across multiple compromised computers (botnet), amplifying the impact.
The victim’s server becomes overwhelmed and is unable to serve legitimate requests, causing downtime and potentially significant financial losses.</p>

<p>Common Tools:<br>
Botnets (networks of infected devices), DDoS-for-hire services, network traffic amplifiers.</p>

<h2> Impersonation of a Police Officer</h2>
<p><b>Scammers use social engineering techniques to impersonate law enforcement officers, such as police officers or government officials, in an effort to manipulate or frighten the victim into complying with their demands. This is often done through phone calls, emails, or video calls.</b></p>

<p>How it happens:<br>

The scammer calls or messages the victim, claiming to be a police officer or government agent. They may use fake caller IDs that appear to come from legitimate law enforcement numbers.
The scammer’s message often starts with an alarming statement, such as that the victim is involved in illegal activity or that there’s an outstanding warrant for their arrest.
To make the scam seem more convincing, the scammer might use technical jargon, pretend to know personal details about the victim, or reference a fake criminal case.</p>

<p>Common Tools:<br>
Caller ID spoofing, voice modulation software (to sound like an authoritative figure), fake email addresses or domains that appear legitimate, and video conferencing platforms for more personal interaction.</p>
